"""
Creates the `Port` class that provies the tow-to-port repair capabilities for offshore
floating wind farms. The `Port` will control a series of tugboats enabled through the
"TOW" capability that get automatically dispatched once a tow-to-port repair is
submitted and a tugboat is available (`ServiceEquipment.at_port`). The `Port` also
controls any mooring repairs through the "AHV" capability, which operates similarly to
the tow-to-port except that it will not be released until the repair is completed, and
operates on a strict shift scheduling basis.

        or the more granula cost bucket: ``marine_management``

    Parameters
    ----------
    env : WombatEnvironment
        The simulation environment instance.
    windfarm : Windfarm
        The simulation windfarm instance.
    repair_manager : RepairManager
        The simulation repair manager instance.
    config : dict | str | Path
        A path to a YAML object or dictionary encoding the port's configuration settings.
        This will be loaded into a ``PortConfig`` object during initialization.

    Attributes
    ----------
    env : WombatEnvironment
        The simulation environment instance.
    windfarm : Windfarm
        The simulation windfarm instance.
    manager : RepairManager
        The simulation repair manager instance.
    settings : PortConfig
        The port's configuration settings, as provided by the user.
    requests_serviced : set[str]
        The set of requests that have already been serviced to ensure there are no
        duplications of labor when splitting out the repair requests to be processed.
    turbine_manager : simpy.Resource
        A SimPy ``Resource`` object that limits the number of turbines that can be towed
        to port, so as not to overload the quayside waters, which is controlled by
        ``settings.max_operations``.
    crew_manager : simpy.Resource
        A SimPy ``Resource`` object that limts the number of repairs that can be
        occurring at any given time, which is controlled by ``settings.n_crews``.
    tugboat_manager : simpy.FilterStore
        A SimPy ``FilterStore`` object that acts as a coordination system for the
        registered tugboats to tow turbines between port and site. In order to tow
        in either direction they must be filtered by ``ServiceEquipment.at_port``. This
        is generated from the tugboat definitions in ``settings.tugboats``.
    active_repairs : dict[str, dict[str, simpy.events.Event]]
        A nested dictionary of turbines, and its associated request IDs with a SimPy
        ``Event``. The use of events allows them to automatically succeed at the end of
        repairs, and once all repairs are processed on a turbine, the tow-to-site
        process can commence.
