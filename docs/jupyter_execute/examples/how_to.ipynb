    "### Environmental Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using weather conditions for site characteristics, WOMBAT is able to\n",
    "model environmental considerations where a port or site cannot be accessed, for example,\n",
    "when silt builds up and water depths become too low to tow a turbine into the port.\n",
    "There is also a feature for imposing maximum operating speeds, such as when there are\n",
    "animal migrations and vessels must slow down to avoid collisions with endangered species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the `non_operational_start` and `non_operational_end` at either the servicing\n",
    "equipment, environment, or port level allows for the creation of an annualized date\n",
    "range spanning the length of the simulation where operations are not allowed to occur.\n",
    "When defined at the environment level, all servicing equipment and a port, if defined,\n",
    "will have this non-operational period applied, and if it's already existing, the more\n",
    "conservative of the date ranges will be applied. When defined at the port level, all\n",
    "associated servicing equipment (tugboats) will have the same inuring priority as when\n",
    "defined at the environment level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic applies when defining the `reduced_speed_start` and `reduced_speed_end`\n",
    "for defining when the operating speeds of servicing equipment are capped at the\n",
    "`reduced_speed`. As is the case above, these variables can also be defined at the\n",
    "servicing equipment level for further customization.\n",

    "\n",
    "WOMBAT uses PySAM to model the financials of the windfarm and retrieve higher-level cost\n",
    "metrics only data is passed into the `SAM_settings` filed in the main configuration. An\n",

    "\n",
    "The actual assets on the windfarm such as cables, turbines, and substations, are\n",

    "\n",
    "- maintenance: scheduled, fixed time interval-based maintenance tasks\n",
    "- failures: unscheduled, Weibull distribution-based modeled, maintenance tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The subassemblies keys in the system YAML definition can be user-defined\n",
