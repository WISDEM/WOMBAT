# Demonstration of the Available Metrics

For a complete list of metrics and their documentation, please see the API Metrics
[documentation](simulation-api:metrics).

This demonstration will rely on the results produced in the "How To" notebook and serves
as an extension of the API documentation to show what the results will look like
depending on what inputs are provided.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
from pprint import pprint
from functools import partial

import pandas as pd
from pandas.io.formats.style import Styler

from wombat.core import Simulation, Metrics

# Clean up the aesthetics for the pandas outputs
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 30)
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", 10)

(metrics-demo:setup)=
## Setup

The simulations from the *How To* notebook are going to be rerun as it is not
recommended to create a Metrics class from scratch due to the large number of inputs
that are required, and the initialization is provided in the simulation API's run method.

To simplify this process, a feature has been added to save the simulation outputs
required to generate the Metrics inputs and a method to reload those outputs as inputs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
sim = Simulation("DINWOODIE", "base.yaml")

# Both of these parameters are True by default for convenience
sim.run(create_metrics=True, save_metrics_inputs=True)

# Load the metrics data
fpath = sim.env.metrics_input_fname.parent
fname = sim.env.metrics_input_fname.name
metrics = Metrics.from_simulation_outputs(fpath, fname)

# Delete the log files now that they're loaded in
sim.env.cleanup_log_files()

# Alternatively, in this case because the simulation was run, we can use the
# following for convenience convenience only
metrics = sim.metrics
```

(metrics-demo:common-parameters)=
## Common Parameter Explanations

Before diving into each and every metric, and how they can be customized, it is worth
noting some of the most common parameters used throughout, and their meanings to reduce
redundancy. The varying output forms are demonstrated in the
[availability](metrics-demo:availability) section below.

### `frequency`

  project
  : Computed across the whole simulation, with the resulting `DataFrame` having an empty
    index.

  annual
  : Summary of each year in the simulation, with the resulting `DataFrame` having "year"
    as the index.

  monthly
  : Summary of each month of the year, aggregated across years, with the resulting
    `DataFrame` having "month" as the index.

  month-year
  : computed on a month-by-year basis, producing the results for every month of the
    simulation, with the resulting `DataFrame` having "year" and "month" as the index.

### `by`

  windfarm
  : Aggregated across all turbines, with the resulting `DataFrame` having only
    "windfarm" as a column

  turbine
  : Computed for each turbine, with the resulting `DataFrame` having a column for each
    turbine

(metrics-demo:availability)=
## Availability

There are two methods to produce availability, which have their own function calls:

- energy: actual power produced divided by potential power produced
  - {py:meth}`wombat.core.post_processor.Metrics.production_based_availability`
- time: The ratio of all non-zero hours to all hours in the simulation, or the
  proportion of the simulation where turbines are operating
  - {py:meth}`wombat.core.post_processor.Metrics.time_based_availability`

Here, we will go through the various input definitions to get time-based availability data as both methods use the same inputs, and provide outputs in the same format.

**Inputs**:

- `frequency`, as explained [above](metrics-demo:common-parameters) options: "project",
  "annual", "monthly", and "month-year"
- `by`, as explained [above](metrics-demo:common-parameters) options: "windfarm" and
  "turbine"

Below is a demonstration of the variations on `frequency` and `by` for
`time_based_availability`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
style(metrics.time_based_availability(frequency="project", by="windfarm"))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
style(metrics.production_based_availability(frequency="project", by="windfarm"))
```

Note that in the two above examples, that the values are equal. This is due to the fact
that the example simulation does not have any operating reduction applied to failures,
unless it's a catastrophic failure, so there is no expected difference.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
# Demonstrate the by turbine granularity
style(metrics.time_based_availability(frequency="project", by="turbine"))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
# Demonstrate the annualized outputs
style(metrics.time_based_availability(frequency="annual", by="windfarm"))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
# Demonstrate the month aggregations
style(metrics.time_based_availability(frequency="monthly", by="windfarm"))
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
# Demonstrate the granular monthly reporting
style(metrics.time_based_availability(frequency="month-year", by="windfarm"))
```

(metrics-demo:cf)=
## Capacity Factor

The capacity factor is the ratio of actual (net) or potential (gross) energy production
divided by the project's capacity. For further documentation, see the API docs here:

  "annual", "monthly", and "month-year"
- `by`, as explained [above](metrics-demo:common-parameters), options: "windfarm" and
  "turbine"

**Example Usage**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
net_cf = metrics.capacity_factor(which="net", frequency="project", by="windfarm").values[0][0]
gross_cf = metrics.capacity_factor(which="gross", frequency="project", by="windfarm").values[0][0]
print(f"  Net capacity factor: {net_cf:.2%}")
print(f"Gross capacity factor: {gross_cf:.2%}")
```

(metrics-demo:task-completion)=
## Task Completion Rate

The task completion rate is the ratio of tasks completed aggregated to the desired
`frequency`. It is possible to have a >100% completion rate if all maintenance and
failure requests submitted in a time period were completed in addition to those that
went unfinished in prior time periods. For further documentation, see the API docs here:
{py:meth}`wombat.core.post_processor.Metrics.task_completion_rate`.

**Inputs**:

- `which`
  - "scheduled": scheduled maintenance only (classified as maintenance tasks in inputs)
  - "unscheduled": unscheduled maintenance only (classified as failure events in inputs)
  - "both": Combined completion rate for all tasks
- `frequency`, as explained [above](metrics-demo:common-parameters), options: "project",
  "annual", "monthly", and "month-year"

**Example Usage**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: ["output_scroll"]
scheduled = metrics.task_completion_rate(which="scheduled", frequency="project").values[0][0]
unscheduled = metrics.task_completion_rate(which="unscheduled", frequency="project").values[0][0]
combined = metrics.task_completion_rate(which="both", frequency="project").values[0][0]
