# Examples Reference

This page will provide a brief overview of the varying examples available in the
[examples folder on GitHub](https://github.com/WISDEM/WOMBAT/blob/main/examples).

## `archival/`

This contains the old notebooks and data used to prepare the unveiling of the model to
DOE. The results are displayed in
[presentations section](presentations:fy20-doe) of the documentation.

## Explanations

The following notebooks are aimed at demonstrating and explaining various functionality
to users.

### `how_to.ipynb`

This is a Jupyter Notebook version of the [*How To* section](./how_to.md) of the
documentation that allows users to interact with the walk through.

### `strategy_demonstration.ipynb`

This is a Jupyter Notebook version of the
[*Strategy Demonstration* section](./strategy_demonstration.md) of the documentation
that allows users to interact with the walk through.

### `metrics_demonstration.ipynb`

This is a Jupyter Notebook version of the
[*Metrics Demonstration* section](./metrics_demonstration.md) of the documentation that
allows users to interact with the varying maintenance strategy models.

### `NAWEA_interactive_walkthrough.ipynb`

This is the notebook used for the NAWEA WindTech 2023 Workshop. See
[here](../workshops/nawea_wind_tech_2023.md) for details.

## Validation

### `dinwoodie_validation.ipynb`

This shows the latest results of the model validation using the modeling parameters from
Dinwoodie, et. al, 2015 [^dinwoodie2015reference].

### `iea_26_validation.ipynb`

This shows the latest results of the model validation using the modeling parameters from
IEA, 2016 [^smart2016iea].

### `timing_benchmarks.ipynb`

This notebook is a simple benchmark for comparing run times between releases from NREL's
FY22 & FY23. That said, there has been a change in computers since running this, and
the listed times for v0.7 in the notebooks will not match those in this example.
