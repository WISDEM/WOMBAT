# Servicing Strategies

In this example, we'll demonstrate the essential differences in scheduled servicing, unscheduled servicing, and tow-to-port repair strategies. Each of the examples demonstrated below will be based on the 2015 Dinwoodie, et al. paper, though the variations will be for demonstration purposes only.

## WOMBAT Setup and Variables

The vessels that will be changed in this demonstration are the field support vessel (FSV) with capability: "SCN", the heavy lift vessel (HLV) with capability: "LCN", and the tugboats, which have capability: "TOW".

```{note}
When running tow-to-port a `Port` configuration is also required, which will control the tugboats. However, the port costs will still be accounted for in the
`FixedCosts` class as port fees are assumed to be constant. These costs are not considered in this example, so differences in cost should be taken with a grain
of salt given the reduction of HLV and FSV operational and mobilization costs.
```

Scenario descriptions:
- **Scheduled**: exactly the same as the base case (fsv_scheduled.yaml and hlv_scheduled.yaml)
- **Unscheduled: requests**: the FSV and HLV are called to site when 10 requests that
  they can service are logged (fsv_requests.yaml and hlv_requests.yaml)
- **Unscheduled: downtime**: the FSV and HLV are called to site once the wind farm's
  operating level hits 90% or lower (fsv_downtime.yaml and hlv_downtime.yaml)
 - **Unscheduled: tow-to-port**: the FSV and HLV will be replaced with three identical
  tugboats (tugboat1.yaml, tugboat2.yaml, tugboat3.yaml), and all the failures associated
  with the FSV and HLV will be changed to capability "TOW" to trigger the tow-to-port
  repairs. These processes will be triggered on the first request (WOMBAT base
  assumption that can't be changed for now).

In this example, we will demonstrate how the results for the base case for the Dinwoodie, et al. example vary based on how each of the vessels are scheduled. The configuration details all remain the same, regardless of details, except for the strategy information, which is defined as follows:

This example is set up similarly to that of the validation cases to show how the results differ, and not a step-by-step guide for setting up the analyses. We refer the reader to the extensive [documentation](../API/index.md) and [How To example](how_to.md) for more information.

## Imports and notebook configuration

```{code-cell} ipython3
from copy import deepcopy
from time import perf_counter

import pandas as pd

from wombat.core import Simulation
from wombat.core.library import DINWOODIE

pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 1000)
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", 1000)
pd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format
```

## Simulation and results setup

Here we're providing the names of the configuration files (found at: dinwoodie / config)
without their .yaml extensions (added in later) and the results that we want to compare
between simulations to understand some of the timing and cost trade-offs between
simulations.

The dictionary of keys and lists will be used to create the results data frame where the
keys will be the indices and the lists will be the row values for each of the above
configurations.

```{code-cell} ipython3
configs = [
    "base_scheduled",
    "base_requests",
    "base_downtime",
    "base_tow_to_port",
]

columns = deepcopy(configs) # Create a unique copy of the config names for column naming
results = {
    "availability - time based": [],
    "availability - production based": [],
    "capacity factor - net": [],
    "capacity factor - gross": [],
    "power production": [],
    "task completion rate": [],
    "annual direct O&M cost": [],
    "annual vessel cost": [],
    "ctv cost": [],
    "fsv cost": [],
    "hlv cost": [],
    "tow cost": [],
    "annual repair cost": [],
    "annual technician cost": [],
    "ctv utilization": [],
    "fsv utilization": [],
    "hlv utilization": [],
    "tow utilization": [],
}
```
