Examples
========

Below are a couple of examples to get started, for users interested in the validation
work in the
[code-to-code comparison presentations](../presentations.rst#code-to-code-comparison),
they can be found in the main repository
`here <https://github.com/WISDEM/WOMBAT/examples/>`_, where there is a separate analysis
for the
`Dinwoodie, et. al, 2015 comparison <https://github.com/WISDEM/WOMBAT/blob/main/examples/dinwoodie_validation.ipynb>`_,
and for the `IEA Task 26, 2016 comparison <https://github.com/WISDEM/blob/main/WOMBAT/examples/iea_26_validation.ipynb>`_.
