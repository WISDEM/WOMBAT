## Code-to-Code Comparison

This document serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of this work in reference to
two major works to document simulated O&M results from various industry and research
software systems. Here we compare our software to the published results from
Dinwoodie, et. al, 2015 [^dinwoodie2015reference] and IEA, 2016 [^smart2016iea].
