## Developing a holistic operation and maintenance simulation tool for emerging offshore wind projects, 2025

The 2025 doctoral dissertation by Nadezda Avanessova {cite}`avanessova_2025` highlights a
comparison of ORE Catapult's COMPASS, WavEC's O&M Tool, and NREL's WOMBAT for offshore wind O&M.

## Code-to-Code Comparison

This document serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of this work in reference to
two major works to document simulated O&M results from various industry and research
software systems. Here we compare our software to the published results from
{cite:t}`dinwoodie2015reference` and {cite:t}`smart2016iea`.

## IEA Task 26 Presentation

This presentation was given to the IEA Task Force responsible for {cite:t}`smart2016iea`
as a demonstration of NREL's efforts on O&M model development.
